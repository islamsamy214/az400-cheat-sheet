# Introduction

## Key Concepts
- **DevSecOps**: Integrates security throughout the development lifecycle, making it everyone's responsibility
- **Shift Left**: Moving security considerations earlier in development when issues are cheaper to fix
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers so if one fails, others remain effective
- **Continuous Security**: Security as an ongoing process, not a one-time checkpoint

## The Security Challenge
- Traditional perimeter-based security (firewalls, network controls) fails in distributed cloud environments
- Modern apps span multiple services, regions, and cloud providers
- Security must be embedded at multiple levels: code, infrastructure, network, data, identity

## DevSecOps Approach
- Security teams collaborate with developers and operations throughout the lifecycle
- Security becomes shared responsibility across the entire team
- Vulnerabilities found in code review cost far less than those in production

## Security as Continuous Process

| Component | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| **Secure Infrastructure** | Hardened OS, configured networks, encrypted storage, secure identity |
| **Architecture** | Defense in depth, layered security controls |
| **Continuous Validation** | Automated security testing, vulnerability scans, compliance checks |
| **Monitoring & Response** | Threat detection, anomaly detection, automated remediation |

## Module Coverage
- SQL injection attacks and prevention
- DevSecOps principles and integration
- Pipeline security validation points
- Threat modeling approaches
- Automated security analysis with GitHub CodeQL

## Critical Notes
- ⚠️ Speed without security creates risk
- 💡 Security shouldn't sacrifice development velocity
- 🎯 Automation enables security teams to focus on complex threats
- 📊 Multiple security layers provide redundancy
