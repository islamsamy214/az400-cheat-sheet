# Introduction

## Key Concepts
- **Open-Source Foundation**: Modern software built on open-source libraries, frameworks, and tools
- **Risk Management**: Security vulnerabilities, license compliance, supply chain risks require attention
- **Effective Implementation**: Balance benefits with proper governance and management

## Why This Matters
- Open-source components power majority of applications today
- Web frameworks, databases, operating systems, development tools all rely on OSS
- Improper management leads to: security breaches, legal liabilities, unexpected costs, operational disruptions

## Module Coverage

### 1. Understanding Modern Software Development
- How apps combine original code with open-source components
- Why organizations choose open-source (faster development, proven solutions, community support, cost savings)

### 2. Corporate Concerns About Open-Source
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- License compliance requirements
- Supply chain risks
- Unmaintained/abandoned projects
- Managing thousands of dependencies across applications

### 3. Open-Source License Fundamentals
- **Permissive Licenses**: MIT, Apache (broad commercial use)
- **Copyleft Licenses**: GPL (derivative works must use same license)
- License characteristics for informed decision-making

### 4. License Implications for Commercial Software
- Restrictions on proprietary software
- Source code disclosure requirements
- Attribution requirements
- License compatibility concerns

### 5. Management Strategies
- Maintain component inventories
- Scan for vulnerabilities
- Track license obligations
- Establish approval processes
- Use automated tools for continuous monitoring

## Learning Objectives
After this module, you can:
- Understand how modern software uses OSS for velocity, quality, innovation
- Explain corporate concerns (security, compliance, supply chain, scale challenges)
- Describe common licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL, BSD) with characteristics
- Evaluate license implications for commercial development
- Implement management strategies (inventory, scanning, compliance, workflows)

## Prerequisites
- Basic software development knowledge (libraries, frameworks, dependencies)
- DevOps concepts familiarity (CI/CD, SDLC)
- Version control experience (Git)
- General licensing awareness

## Critical Notes
- ⚠️ Open-source is foundation of modern development
- 💡 Security vulnerabilities and license compliance require careful attention
- 🎯 Proper management prevents legal liabilities and security breaches
- 📊 Thousands of dependencies require automated monitoring
