# What is Open-Source Software?

## Definition (Open Source Initiative)
"Open-source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. The copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose, subject to the terms of an open-source license."

## Key Principles
- **Source Code Availability**: Complete source code publicly accessible, not just binaries
- **Freedom to Modify**: Users can change software for needs, fix bugs, add features
- **Redistribution Rights**: Share software (original or modified) with others
- **License Terms**: Permissions, restrictions, obligations defined by OSS license

## Collaborative Open-Source Model

### Community-Driven Development
- **Distributed Contributors**: Worldwide developers contribute code, docs, testing, support
- **Voluntary Participation**: Motivated by problem-solving, learning, reputation, supporting tools they use
- **Meritocracy**: Influence correlates with contribution quality/quantity, not hierarchy
- **Transparent Processes**: Development in public repos with visible discussions/decisions

### Collaborative Workflows
```yaml
Public Repositories:  GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket (anyone can view)
Issue Tracking:       Bugs/features tracked publicly
Pull Request Reviews: Changes reviewed by maintainers/community before merge
Release Management:   Maintainers coordinate stable releases
```

### Project Governance Models
| Model | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Benevolent Dictator** | Single individual makes final decisions | Python (Guido van Rossum) |
| **Core Team** | Small group decides via consensus/voting | Many medium projects |
| **Foundation Governance** | Legal structure with formal frameworks | Apache, Linux Foundation |
| **Corporate Sponsorship** | Company employees maintain project | Many enterprise projects |

## Widespread Adoption

### Industry Statistics
- **Enterprise**: 90%+ use OSS in production
- **Internet Infrastructure**: Majority on Linux, Apache/Nginx, PostgreSQL/MySQL
- **Cloud Computing**: Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform foundation of modern cloud
- **Mobile**: Android built on Linux kernel with extensive OSS components

### Technology Stack Composition
```yaml
Operating Systems:  Linux (cloud, containers, embedded)
Languages:          Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP
Databases:          PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch
Web Technologies:   React, Angular, Vue.js, Express, Django, Rails
Dev Tools:          Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, VS Code
```

## Microsoft's Embrace of Open-Source

### Historical Shift
- Previously viewed OSS as threat to proprietary business
- Dramatic change over past decade recognizing strategic importance

### Open-Source in Azure
- **Languages/Runtimes**: Python, Node.js, Java, PHP, Ruby, Go (first-class support)
- **Databases**: Managed PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Redis
- **Container Orchestration**: AKS (managed Kubernetes)
- **Dev Tools**: Azure DevOps integrates Git/Jenkins; GitHub acquired
- **Data/Analytics**: Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kafka support

### .NET Transformation
```yaml
Open-Sourcing:        .NET Core (now .NET 5+) under MIT license
Cross-Platform:       Windows, Linux, macOS support
Community Contributions: Thousands from outside Microsoft
OSS Dependencies:     jQuery, React, Angular, Newtonsoft.Json, Serilog, xUnit, NUnit
```

### Contributing to OSS Projects
- **Linux Kernel**: Hyper-V integration, Azure infrastructure support
- **Kubernetes**: Major contributor shaping platform for AKS
- **OSS Initiatives**: Sponsoring events, funding critical infrastructure, employing full-time OSS devs

### Microsoft-Created OSS Projects
- **VS Code**: Most popular code editor (open-source)
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript development language
- **PowerShell Core**: Cross-platform automation framework
- **.NET Foundation**: Supporting OSS projects in .NET ecosystem

### Strategic Rationale
```yaml
Developer Adoption:     Developers prefer OSS → attracts to platforms
Cloud Business:         OSS workloads drive cloud adoption
Innovation Speed:       Community contributions reduce dev burden
Ecosystem Growth:       Communities create extensions/tools/knowledge
Competitive Positioning: Match/exceed AWS, Google Cloud OSS capabilities
```

## Why Organizations Choose Open-Source

| Reason | Benefits |
|--------|----------|
| **Cost** | No licensing fees, especially at scale |
| **Flexibility & Control** | Modify for specific needs, fix bugs independently, not locked to vendor timelines |
| **Transparency & Security** | Source auditable, community review faster, no hidden backdoors |
| **Avoid Vendor Lock-In** | Deploy anywhere, reduce vendor dependence |
| **Community Support** | Forums, docs, tutorials often rival/exceed commercial support |
| **Innovation & Features** | Cutting-edge tech emerges in OSS first, contribute needed features |

## Critical Notes
- ⚠️ 90%+ enterprises use OSS in production
- 💡 Modern tech stacks predominantly open-source
- 🎯 Microsoft transformed from OSS opponent to major contributor
- 📊 Community contributions accelerate innovation and reduce costs
