# Introduction

## Key Concepts
- **Identity as Security Perimeter**: Replace network-based security with identity-based
- **Centralized Access Control**: Manage cloud and on-premises resources from single location
- **Microsoft Entra ID**: Cloud identity and access management service
- **99.9% Attack Prevention**: SSO + MFA protects against most cyber attacks

## Module Objectives
1. Understand Microsoft Entra ID vs Windows Server Active Directory differences
2. Learn tenants, subscriptions, and user relationships
3. Create and configure Microsoft Entra ID
4. Manage users and groups effectively
5. Implement RBAC (role-based access control)
6. Build hybrid identity with Azure AD Connect

## Scenario
- Company transitioning workloads to cloud
- Need centralized identity management
- Control user access to data and services
- Ensure least-privilege access
- Handle employee and vendor lifecycle (offboarding = revoke access)

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of identity and RBAC
- Experience with Azure Portal
- Familiarity with Microsoft Entra admin center

## Critical Notes
- ⚠️ **Security is complex**: Easy to misconfigure, high-profile breaches common
- 💡 **Just-enough access**: Principle of least privilege for every user/vendor
- 🎯 **Lifecycle management**: Onboarding easy, offboarding critical (revoke access immediately)
- 📊 **SSO + MFA**: Combined protection against 99.9% of attacks
- 🔄 **Cloud + on-premises**: Hybrid identity supports both environments
- ✨ **Centralized control**: Single identity for Azure, Microsoft 365, SaaS apps
