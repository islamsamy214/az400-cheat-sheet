# Develop a Just Culture

## Key Concepts
- Engineers are experts in their own errors
- Just Culture requires leadership commitment
- Focus on learning over blame
- Bridge gap between blunt end (management) and sharp end (engineers)
- Engineers enthusiastic about helping organization when they feel safe

## Engineers as Experts in Their Errors

### Unique Expertise
Engineers who made mistakes understand:
- Context that made action seem reasonable
- Information they had (and didn't have) at the time
- Pressures and constraints they worked under
- Assumptions made and why they seemed valid
- Cascading effects observed as incident unfolded

### Essential Involvement in Remediation
- Should be heavily involved in developing remediation items
- Uniquely qualified to suggest improvements preventing recurrence
- Better than superficial changes not addressing root causes

### Not "Off the Hook"
- Very much on the hook for helping organization become safer/resilient
- Transforms failure from shame into opportunity for contribution
- Most engineers find making things better for others worthwhile

## Principles for Enabling Just Culture

### 1. Encourage Learning Through Blameless Postmortems

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Regular practice** | Conduct on outages/accidents as standard, not exceptional events |
| **Understand how accidents happen** | Better equip ourselves to prevent future occurrences |
| **Focus on mechanisms** | Investigate failure mechanisms, conditions, what made action seem right |

**Not**: "Who caused it?" (doesn't improve safety)

### 2. Gather Multiple Perspectives Without Punishment

**Multiple viewpoints**:
- Different people have different information/observations
- Combining perspectives provides complete picture

**No punishment for mistakes**:
- Punishment shuts down information flow needed for learning

**Give authority to improve**:
- Empower engineers to improve safety
- Provide detailed accounts of contributions to failures
- Be part of solution

### 3. Transform Mistakes into Organizational Learning

| Action | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Educate others** | Enable/encourage people who made mistakes to teach organization |
| **Documentation and sharing** | Document lessons in accessible formats, share reviews widely |
| **Training incorporation** | Use anonymized case studies from actual incidents (more valuable than hypothetical) |

### 4. Accept Human Discretion and Decision-Making

**Discretionary space always exists**:
- Procedures and automation don't eliminate human judgment
- They constrain it but don't remove it

**Judgment occurs in hindsight**:
- We assess decisions with information person didn't have

**Hindsight bias awareness**:
- Work hard to eliminate it
- Ask: "What made sense given what they knew then?"
- Not: "Why didn't they do what we now know they should have done?"

### 5. Focus on Environmental Factors

**Fundamental attribution error**:
- Cognitive bias: attribute others' actions to character vs. circumstances
- Difficult to escape

**Environment and circumstances**:
- What pressures existed?
- What information was missing?
- What time constraints applied?
- What goals were they pursuing?

**System factors, not personal factors**: Ask what system factors contributed (not personal characteristics)

### 6. Bridge the Gap Between Blunt End and Sharp End

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Blunt end** | Management, leadership |
| **Sharp end** | Engineers interacting with systems |
| **Understand actual work** | How work is actually getting done (not imagined work) |
| **Reality vs. idealized** | Real work involves improvisation, workarounds, adaptation |
| **Regular communication** | Channels for sharp end to inform about conditions/challenges/risks without fear |

**Key insight**: Procedures describe idealized work, not actual work

### 7. Define Appropriate Behavior Collaboratively

**Sharp end defines boundaries**:
- Relied upon to inform about line between appropriate/inappropriate behavior
- Not something blunt end can determine alone

**Ground truth**:
- Engineers have daily ground truth about:
  - What's achievable
  - What shortcuts are necessary
  - What risks are unavoidable given constraints

**Collaborative standards**:
- Develop between sharp and blunt ends
- Not top-down rules that don't reflect operational reality

## Understanding Our Reactions to Failure

### Two Approaches to Failure

| Approach | Assumptions | Actions | Result |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| **Blame and deterrence** | Single cause is incompetence | Scream "pay attention!" or "be more careful!" | Problem is motivation/character, fear prevents failures |
| **Learning and respect** | Context matters | Thorough investigation, treat engineers with respect | Understand circumstances, improve systems |

### Why Learning Works Better Than Blame

| Aspect | Blame | Learning |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Feeling** | False comfort - feels like problem-solving | More work but lasting improvements |
| **Safety improvement** | Doesn't improve system safety | Modifies systems/processes/environments |
| **Engineer behavior** | Dishonest, protective | Honest, detailed accounts |
| **Culture sustainability** | Unsustainable, hiding problems | Sustainable, engaged, psychologically safe |

## Implementing Just Culture in Practice

### 1. Start with Leadership
- Must begin with leadership commitment
- Leaders demonstrate through actions they value learning > blame

### 2. Train Facilitators
- Train people to facilitate blameless post-mortems
- Requires specific skills in asking questions focusing on circumstances (not blame)

### 3. Create Psychological Safety
- Build gradually through consistent application
- **Critical**: One punitive response can undo months of culture-building

### 4. Measure What Matters
Track:
- Time to detection
- Time to mitigation
- Quality of post-mortem documentation

**Not**: "Who was responsible?"

### 5. Celebrate Transparency
- Publicly recognize engineers providing transparent accounts
- Reinforces that honesty is valued

## Key Cognitive Biases to Overcome

| Bias | Description | How to Combat |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Hindsight bias** | "They should have known better" after the fact | Ask what made sense with information they had |
| **Fundamental attribution error** | Attributing actions to character vs. circumstances | Focus on environmental factors and pressures |

## Critical Notes
- ⚠️ One punitive response undoes months of culture-building
- 💡 Engineers become experts in their own errors
- 🎯 Actual work ≠ idealized work in procedures
- 📊 Sharp end has ground truth about operational reality
- 🔍 Measure time to detection/mitigation, not "who was responsible"
- 🚀 Treating engineers with respect encourages honest, detailed accounts
