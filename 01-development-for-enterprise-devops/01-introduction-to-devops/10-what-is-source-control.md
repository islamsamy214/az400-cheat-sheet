# What is Source Control?

## Key Concepts
- **Source Control System** (Version Control System): Allows developers to collaborate on code and track changes
- Saves snapshots of files (history) for review and rollback
- Essential tool for multi-developer projects
- Resolves conflicts when merging contributions from multiple sources

## Core Benefits

### For Developers (Daily Enabler)
- Collaborate without conflicts
- Track who made changes, when, and what exactly
- Experiment safely with new ideas
- Roll back to previous working versions easily
- Part of daily workflow—one of most-used tools

### For Management (Strategic Value)
| Value Area | Benefit |
|------------|---------|
| **IP Security** | Protect invaluable knowledge and understanding |
| **Risk Management** | Prevent catastrophic loss and human error |
| **Time-to-Market** | Fundamental enabler for Continuous Delivery |

## Why Source Control Matters

### Without Version Control ❌
- Tempted to keep multiple code copies
- Easy to change/delete wrong file
- Potential work loss
- Painful collaboration
- No change tracking

### With Version Control ✅
- Single version presented at a time
- All versions managed systematically
- Safe experimentation
- Collaboration made possible
- Complete change history

## Foundation for DevOps
Version control is the **first step** needed to:
- Assure quality at the source
- Ensure flow and pull value
- Focus on process improvement
- Create value for customers

**Critical**: Tools like Agile, CI, and DevOps all **rely on solid version control practice**

## Source Code as Repository
- Invaluable knowledge about problem domain
- Collected and refined through careful effort
- Protected from catastrophe and degradation
- Understanding preserved for the team

## Critical Notes
- 🎯 Version control is **foundational** to all DevOps practices
- ⚠️ Without it, Agile, CI, and CD cannot function properly
- 💡 Enables collaboration, experimentation, and safe rollback
- 📊 Tracks who, what, when for accountability and audit
