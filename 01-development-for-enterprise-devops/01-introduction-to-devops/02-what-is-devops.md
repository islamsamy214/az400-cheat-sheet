# What is DevOps?

## Key Concepts
- **DevOps = Dev + Ops**: Replacing siloed teams with multidisciplinary collaboration
- Shared practices, tools, and accountability for outcomes
- Essential practices: Agile planning, CI, CD, monitoring
- Continuous journey of improvement, not a destination

## Business Value Metrics
Organizations implementing DevOps see improvements in:

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Deployment frequency | Infrequent → regular, predictable |
| Lead time | Extended cycles → shorter timeframes |
| MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery) | Faster incident resolution |
| Change failure rate | Fewer production issues |

**Expected Benefits**:
- Reduced time-to-market
- Decreased deployment incidents
- Improved developer productivity/satisfaction
- Lower operational costs via automation

## OODA Loop Framework
Fighter pilot strategy applied to software development:

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Observe** | Monitor metrics, trends, user behavior, telemetry |
| **Orient** | Analyze delivery options, run experiments |
| **Decide** | Choose priorities based on data |
| **Act** | Ship to users, collect feedback |

## Cycle Time Calculation
**Exercise**: How long from code commit → production deployment?

Example: If a one-line config change takes 2 weeks to deploy, your cycle time = 2 weeks = velocity constraint.

## Data-Informed Decision Making
- **Pivot or Persevere**: Fail fast on poor initiatives, double down on successes
- Deployment outcomes vary: negative, positive, or neutral
- Don't be paralyzed by analysis—act on evidence

### Validated Learning Metrics
- User engagement and feature adoption rates
- System performance and error rates
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Business KPIs (revenue, conversion, retention)

## Shortening Cycle Time
Achieve faster cycles by:
- Working in smaller batches
- Increasing automation
- Hardening release pipelines
- Improving telemetry
- Deploying more frequently

## Critical Notes
- 🎯 **Goal**: Shorten cycle time to increase experiment frequency
- 💡 More deployments = more pivot/persevere opportunities
- ⚠️ Value of improvement = progress achieved + failures avoided
- 📊 Make decisions from **empirical evidence**, not assumptions
