# Identify Transformation Teams

## Key Challenges
- **Availability**: Team members with day-to-day responsibilities can't focus on transformation
- **Organizational Inertia**: Existing processes make disrupting status quo difficult
- **Competing Priorities**: Customer emergencies always trump long-term projects

## Research Foundation
Dr. Vijay Govindarajan & Dr. Chris Trimble: "Successful innovation often occurs **despite** existing organizational processes"
- **Solution**: Create a **separate dedicated team** for transformation

## Core Team Composition (3-7 People)

| Role | Time Commitment | Key Responsibilities | Success Metrics |
|------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **DevOps Engineer/Lead** | 100% | Technical architecture, toolchain | Pipeline reliability, deployment frequency, lead time |
| **Development Rep** | 50-75% | Developer experience, workflow optimization | Developer satisfaction, code quality |
| **Operations Rep** | 50-75% | Infrastructure, security, production | System reliability, MTTR, operational efficiency |
| **Change Management Specialist** | 75-100% | Cultural transformation, process adoption | Adoption rates, cultural assessments |
| **Product/Business Rep** | 25-50% | Business value alignment, stakeholder comms | Business outcomes, stakeholder satisfaction |

## Extended Team & Stakeholders

**Security Champion** (25-50%): DevSecOps implementation, compliance, risk assessment  
**Metrics/Analytics Specialist** (Part-time): KPI definition, dashboards, continuous improvement  
**Executive Sponsor** (Advisory): Remove barriers, provide resources, strategic alignment  

## Team Selection Criteria
✅ **Well-regarded throughout organization** (respected voices)  
✅ **Focused on transformation outcomes** (not day-to-day ops)  
✅ **Diverse knowledge and perspectives** (think outside the box)  
✅ **Change-oriented** (challenge status quo, experiment)  
✅ **Collaborative** (work across boundaries)  

Consider **external experts** for: knowledge gaps, objective perspectives, proven practices, specialized skills

## Change Management Strategies

### Address Resistance
1. **Address "Why" First**: Communicate business drivers, share success stories, connect to individual goals
2. **Invest in Training**: Hands-on learning, safe experimentation environments, recognize learning efforts
3. **Gradual Change**: Pilot projects, early adopters, quick wins, scale incrementally
4. **Open Communication**: Town halls, Q&A sessions, feedback channels, transparency about challenges
5. **Celebrate Successes**: Recognize contributions, share improvement metrics, create visible symbols

## Critical Notes
- ⚠️ Don't assign transformation to people with critical operational duties
- 💡 Backfill operational roles when assigning people to transformation team
- 🎯 Transformation team should be measured **only** by transformation outcomes
- 📊 Research-backed: Separate team is necessary for successful innovation
