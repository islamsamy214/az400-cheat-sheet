- [ ] **Establish traceability** for source code, bugs, and quality metrics
- [ ] **Configure dashboards** for real-time project monitoring

## Exam Preparation Tips

### Core Concepts to Master

**GitHub Projects**:
- Three primary view types: Board (visual flow), Table (data analysis), Timeline (scheduling)
- Custom fields: Text, Number, Date, Single select, Iteration
- Automation: Workflows, auto-add, auto-archive
- Team discussions span across multiple projects/repositories

**Azure Boards**:
- Work item hierarchy: Epic → Feature → User Story → Task
- Process templates: Agile, Scrum, Basic, CMMI
- Query types: Flat list, Tree of work items, Direct links
- Delivery Plans for multi-team coordination

**Integration Best Practices**:
- Azure Boards App enables bidirectional linking
- AB# syntax in commits links to Azure Boards work items
- GitHub mentions (#issue-number) link to GitHub Issues
- Authentication options: Azure Repos PAT or GitHub App

**Traceability Framework**:
- GitHub Flow: Single main branch, feature branches, PR reviews
- Semantic commits: Conventional formats for change logs
- Bug classification: Severity levels + Priority matrices
- Quality metrics: Test coverage, pass rates, performance benchmarks
