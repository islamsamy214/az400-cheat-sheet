# Introduction to GitHub Projects and Project Boards

## Overview
**GitHub Projects**: Flexible tools for planning and tracking work across repositories with customizable views (tables, boards, roadmaps).

## Core Capabilities
- **Flexible project views**: Switch between table, board, and roadmap
- **Custom fields**: Dates, numbers, text, selections, iterations
- **Cross-repository integration**: Include issues/PRs from multiple repos
- **Real-time synchronization**: Changes automatically update in project
- **Powerful automation**: Built-in workflows keep project updated

## Project Types & Scope

| Type | Scope | Use Case | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| **User-owned** | Issues/PRs from any accessible repo | Individual management, cross-repo initiatives | Open source maintainers, freelancers, personal projects, individual contributors |
| **Organization-owned** | Issues/PRs within organization | Cross-team coordination, high-level roadmaps | Product roadmaps, company initiatives, release planning, portfolio management |

⚠️ **Note**: Organization projects require appropriate permissions

## Multiple View Types

| View Type | Purpose | Interface | Best For |
|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Table** | Detailed project management & data analysis | Spreadsheet-like, bulk editing | Project managers, detailed planning |
| **Board** | Visual workflow & Kanban tracking | Drag-and-drop cards, status columns | Development teams, agile workflows |
| **Roadmap** | Timeline planning & milestone tracking | Gantt-style, date tracking | Strategic planning, release management |

## Custom Fields for Tracking

| Field Type | Purpose | Example Uses | Application |
|------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Date** | Track deadlines and milestones | Target ship dates, sprint end dates | Timeline management, deadline tracking |
| **Number** | Quantify effort and complexity | Story points, hours estimated | Capacity planning, effort estimation |
| **Single Select** | Categorize and prioritize | Priority, Status, Team assignment | Workflow management, resource allocation |
| **Text** | Add contextual information | Notes, external references, requirements | Context preservation, documentation |
| **Iteration** | Plan work in time-boxed periods | Sprint planning, release cycles | Agile planning, delivery cadence |

## Advanced Iteration & Workflow Management

### Iteration Planning Capabilities
- **Flexible scheduling**: Time-boxed periods with customizable durations
- **Break planning**: Include planned breaks and holidays
- **Capacity tracking**: Monitor team velocity and workload distribution
- **Progress visualization**: Track completion rates, identify bottlenecks
- **Cross-team alignment**: Coordinate iterations across teams/repositories

### Built-in Automation Features
- **Status updates**: Auto-update based on linked issue/PR changes
- **Assignment tracking**: Sync project assignments with repository assignments
- **Label synchronization**: Maintain consistent labeling across issues/project items
- **Milestone integration**: Connect project milestones with repository milestones

## Implementation Strategy

### Project Setup Checklist
1. **Define workflow**: Identify how team organizes and tracks work
2. **Choose project scope**: User-owned vs. organization-owned
3. **Configure custom fields**: Set up fields for important metadata
4. **Create initial views**: Board, table, roadmap for different stakeholders
5. **Set up automation**: Configure built-in workflows
6. **Train your team**: Ensure understanding of usage and maintenance

### Enterprise Scaling Considerations
- **Standardized field schemas**: Consistent custom fields across organization
- **Access control**: Appropriate permissions for stakeholder groups
- **Integration planning**: Connect with existing tools and processes
- **Governance frameworks**: Guidelines for project creation, maintenance, archival
