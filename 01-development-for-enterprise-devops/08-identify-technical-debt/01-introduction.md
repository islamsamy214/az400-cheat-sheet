# Introduction

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you'll be able to:
- Find and manage technical debt in your code
- Use code quality tools to improve your software
- Plan effective code reviews for your team
- Understand complexity and quality metrics

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of DevOps concepts
- Some experience with version control (helpful but not required)
- Experience working in a team that creates software

## Module Focus
This module teaches you how to identify and manage technical debt in your development process. You'll learn to use automated tools for code quality assessment, understand complexity metrics, and implement effective code review practices.

## Key Topics Covered
- **Code Quality Metrics**: Reliability, maintainability, testability, portability, reusability
- **Complexity Metrics**: Cyclomatic complexity, Halstead measures
- **Technical Debt**: Definition, causes, and management strategies
- **Automated Tools**: SonarCloud, GitHub Advanced Security, NDepend, ReSharper
- **Code Reviews**: Best practices for team collaboration and quality improvement

## Why This Matters
Technical debt is one of the main reasons projects fail to meet deadlines. It reduces productivity, frustrates development teams, and increases support costs. This module equips you with tools and practices to prevent technical debt from building up and manage existing debt effectively.

## Critical Notes
- 🎯 Technical debt is like financial debt - it compounds over time with "interest"
- 💡 DevOps processes help find problems earlier, making fixes faster and cheaper
- ⚠️ Individual programmers find less than 50% of bugs in their own code
- 📊 Most testing methods only find 35% of bugs - automation is essential
- 🔄 Quality and speed aren't opposites in DevOps - both improve together
- ✨ Automated quality checks in CI/CD pipelines catch issues before production
