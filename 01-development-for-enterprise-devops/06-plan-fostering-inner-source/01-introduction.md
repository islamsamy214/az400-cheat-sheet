# Introduction

## Key Concepts
- **Inner Source**: Development approach where teams within an organization collaborate using open source principles
- **Breaking Silos**: Enables teams across departments to share code, contribute to projects, and build on existing work
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Teams can contribute to projects they don't normally work on without needing direct write access
- **Fork Workflow**: Primary mechanism for inner source, allowing developers to propose changes without repository permissions

## Why Inner Source Matters

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Breaking Down Silos** | Teams collaborate across department boundaries, sharing knowledge and code |
| **Code Reuse** | Discover and reuse existing solutions instead of rebuilding from scratch |
| **Better Quality** | Multiple teams reviewing code leads to higher quality and fewer bugs |
| **Knowledge Sharing** | Developers learn from each other's work and apply best practices |

## Learning Objectives
- Use Git to foster inner source development across your organization
- Implement fork workflow for collaborative development
- Choose between branches and forks for different collaboration scenarios
- Share code between forks effectively

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Git version control concepts
- Familiarity with collaborative development principles
- Experience working in software development teams

## Critical Notes
- 🎯 Inner source applies open source practices within your organization's firewall
- 💡 Forks enable contribution without requiring write access to repositories
- ⚠️ Proper inner source adoption requires cultural change, not just tooling
- 📊 Teams can maintain autonomy while enabling broader collaboration
- 🔄 Inner source reduces duplication and accelerates innovation
- ✨ Microsoft successfully adopted inner source company-wide using Azure Repos
