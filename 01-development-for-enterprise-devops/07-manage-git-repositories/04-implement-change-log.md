# Implement a Changelog

## Key Concepts
- **Changelog**: File listing changes made to project, organized by version and date
- **Automated Tools**: Generate changelogs from Git history
- **Manual Curation**: Better than raw log dumps for user-facing documentation
- **Version Organization**: Group changes by release version with clear categories

## Typical Changelog Format

### Structure
```markdown
# Changelog

## [2.1.0] - 2024-01-15

### Added
- New feature X for improved performance
- Support for Y integration

### Changed
- Updated Z library to version 3.0
- Improved error messages

### Deprecated
- Feature A will be removed in v3.0

### Removed
- Old API endpoint /api/v1/legacy

### Fixed
- Bug causing crash when processing large files
- Memory leak in background processor

### Security
- Patched CVE-2024-XXXXX vulnerability
```

### Common Categories

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Added** | New features or capabilities |
| **Changed/Improved** | Modifications to existing features |
| **Deprecated** | Features marked for future removal |
| **Removed** | Deleted features or functionality |
| **Fixed** | Bug fixes and corrections |
| **Security** | Security patches and updates |

## Distribution Methods

- **CHANGELOG.md file**: In repository root (most common)
- **Blog posts**: Published on company blog or docs site
- **Release notes**: In GitHub/Azure DevOps releases
- **Documentation site**: Dedicated changelog section

## Automated Changelog Tools

### Using Native Git Commands

```bash
# Generate changelog content from Git history
git log [options] vX.X.X..vX.X.Y | helper-script > projectchangelogs/X.X.Y

# Example: Changes between v2.0.0 and v2.1.0
git log --oneline --pretty=format:"%s" v2.0.0..v2.1.0
```

### gitchangelog (Python-based)

```bash
# Install gitchangelog
pip install gitchangelog

# Generate changelog
gitchangelog > CHANGELOG.md
```

**Features**:
- Parses commit messages
- Groups by version tags
- Customizable output format
- Template-based generation

### GitHub Changelog Generator (Ruby-based)

```bash
# Install gem
gem install github_changelog_generator

# Generate changelog
github_changelog_generator -u username -p repository

# Example
github_changelog_generator -u github-changelog-generator -p TimerTrend-3.0
```

**Features**:
- Pulls data from GitHub API
- Includes pull requests and issues
- Groups by milestones/tags
- Markdown output

## Manual vs. Automated

### Automated Changelogs

**Pros**:
- Quick to generate
- No manual effort
- Always up-to-date with commits

**Cons**:
- Contains too much technical detail
- Includes internal changes users don't care about
- Poorly written commit messages become changelog entries
- Confusing for end users

### Curated Changelogs

**Pros**:
- User-friendly language
- Focuses on what matters to users
- Clear categories and organization
- Better explanation of changes

**Cons**:
- Requires manual effort
- Can become outdated
- Team must maintain discipline

## Best Practice: Hybrid Approach

```bash
# 1. Generate automated changelog as starting point
git log --oneline v1.0.0..v2.0.0 > changelog-draft.txt

# 2. Manually edit to:
#    - Remove internal/technical commits
#    - Group into categories (Added, Fixed, etc.)
#    - Rewrite in user-friendly language
#    - Add context and examples

# 3. Publish curated version
mv changelog-edited.md CHANGELOG.md
```

## Should You Use Autogenerated Log-Based Data?

**⚠️ Generally No**

Reasons to avoid raw log dumps:
- Too much technical detail
- Internal refactoring mixed with user-facing changes
- Poor commit messages become poor changelog entries
- Difficult for users to understand impact
- Creates confusing mess instead of helpful documentation

**Better**: Use automation as starting point, then curate for your audience

## Commit Message Conventions

To make automation more effective:

```bash
# Use conventional commits
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve memory leak in processor
docs: update API documentation
refactor: reorganize data access layer

# This enables:
# - Automatic categorization
# - Semantic version bumps
# - Better changelog generation
```

## Critical Notes
- 🎯 Changelogs should be written for users, not copied from Git logs
- 💡 Use automated tools as starting point, then curate for your audience
- ⚠️ Raw commit logs contain too much technical detail for meaningful changelog
- 📊 Organize by version with clear categories (Added, Fixed, Changed, etc.)
- 🔄 Keep changelog updated with each release for transparency
- ✨ Good commit message conventions improve automated changelog quality
