# Introduction

## Key Concepts
- Package migration strategies for moving artifacts to Azure Artifacts
- Repository consolidation approaches to centralize package management
- Comprehensive security configuration for package feeds
- Roles, permissions, and authentication mechanisms

## Module Coverage
- **Identifying artifact repositories**: Assess existing repositories across organization (self-hosted and third-party solutions)
- **Migration strategies**: Approaches for migrating artifacts with minimal disruption
- **Integration approaches**: Consolidate multiple repositories using upstream sources and gradual migration patterns
- **Securing package feeds**: Implement visibility settings and access controls
- **Roles**: Four Azure Artifacts roles (Reader, Collaborator, Contributor, Owner) and their permissions
- **Permissions**: Configure granular permissions for users, teams, and service principals
- **Authentication**: Set up authentication mechanisms including PATs and credential providers

## Learning Objectives
- Identify artifact repositories and assess migration needs across organization

- Configure feed visibility and access controls to protect packages
- Assign appropriate roles to control feed access at different levels
- Set up granular permissions for users, teams, and groups
- Configure authentication mechanisms for users and build services

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of package management concepts and Azure Artifacts fundamentals
- Familiarity with Azure DevOps organizations and projects
- Basic knowledge of authentication and authorization concepts
- Experience with at least one package type (NuGet, npm, Maven, or Python)
