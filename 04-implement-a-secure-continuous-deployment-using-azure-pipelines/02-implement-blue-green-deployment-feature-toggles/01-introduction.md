# Introduction

**Duration**: 2 minutes  
**Module**: Implement blue-green deployment and feature toggles

## Overview

This module delivers comprehensive **blue-green deployment** methodology implementation and **feature toggle architecture** design for controlled progressive delivery, zero-downtime releases, and dynamic feature management capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- 🎯 **Analyze advanced deployment strategies** and progressive delivery patterns
- 🚀 **Implement blue-green deployment architectures** for zero-downtime releases
- ⚙️ **Configure and manage Azure deployment slots** for environment isolation
- 🔧 **Design and implement feature toggle systems** for dynamic feature control

## Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
- ✅ **DevOps principles**: Foundational understanding of continuous delivery concepts
- ✅ **Version control**: Familiarity with Git and collaborative development workflows
- ✅ **Software delivery**: Experience in software delivery organizations (beneficial context)

### Technical Requirements
- 🔹 **Azure DevOps Organization**: Active organization access
- 🔹 **Team Project**: Access to team project for practical exercises

📖 **Setup Guide**: [Create an organization - Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization)

## What You'll Learn

### 1. Advanced Deployment Strategies
Progressive delivery patterns and zero-downtime release architectures that minimize risk and maximize reliability.

### 2. Blue-Green Deployment Implementation
Parallel environment strategies enabling seamless traffic switching and instant rollback capabilities.

### 3. Azure Deployment Slot Management
Environment isolation techniques, staging configurations, and seamless swap operations using Azure App Service.

### 4. Feature Toggle Lifecycle Management
Dynamic feature control mechanisms, technical debt mitigation strategies, and systematic retirement practices.

## Module Structure

This module consists of 7 units:

1. **Introduction** (current) - Module overview and objectives
2. **What is blue-green deployment?** - Core concepts and architecture
3. **Explore deployment slots** - Azure App Service deployment slots
4. **Introduction to feature toggles** - Feature flag fundamentals
5. **Feature toggle maintenance** - Lifecycle management and technical debt
6. **Knowledge check** - Assessment questions
7. **Summary** - Key takeaways and next steps

## Why This Matters

### Business Impact
- ⚡ **Zero-downtime deployments**: Update applications without service interruption
- 🛡️ **Instant rollback**: Revert to previous version within seconds
- 📊 **Risk mitigation**: Test in production with controlled exposure

### Technical Benefits
- 🔄 **Decoupled deployment**: Separate deployment from feature activation
- 🎛️ **Runtime control**: Enable/disable features without redeployment
- 🧪 **A/B testing**: Data-driven feature decisions with user segmentation

## Key Concepts Preview

### Blue-Green Deployment
Two identical production environments (blue and green) where one serves live traffic while the other is idle, enabling seamless cutover and instant rollback.

### Feature Toggles
Runtime configuration switches that control feature visibility without code deployment, enabling gradual rollout and instant deactivation.

### Azure Deployment Slots
Azure App Service feature providing isolated environments with dedicated hostnames for staging, testing, and production scenarios.
