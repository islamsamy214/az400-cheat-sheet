# Introduction

## Key Concepts
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automated production-ready release pipelines enabling rapid customer value delivery
- **Deployment Patterns**: Strategic approaches to releasing software changes into production
- **Prerequisites**: Testing automation, code quality standards, architectural patterns
- **Azure Pipelines**: Enterprise-grade CI/CD platform for cross-platform deployment automation

## Module Overview
This module explores deployment pattern architectures, microservices design principles, and continuous delivery implementation strategies for modern software delivery excellence.

## CD Prerequisites

### 1. Testing Strategy Frameworks
- **Automated testing infrastructure** eliminates manual validation bottlenecks
- Enables rapid validation cycles essential for continuous deployment
- Comprehensive test automation required for on-demand delivery

### 2. Code Quality Standards
- Maintainable, secure codebases enable sustainable high-frequency releases
- Technical debt constrains rapid, reliable code modification
- Quality-focused development + comprehensive test coverage = CD foundation

### 3. Architectural Patterns
**Challenges**:
- **Monolithic architectures**: Tight coupling creates CD challenges
  * Cascading change impacts
  * Complex dependency management
  * Extensive regression validation needed
- **Cross-team dependencies**: Sequential delivery requirements limit parallel development

**Solution**: Microservices architecture
- Service decomposition
- Autonomous deployment capabilities
- Independent component delivery cycles

## Continuous Integration Foundation
- Version-controlled codebases
- Automated integration frameworks
- Continuous code merging and validation
- Collaborative development at scale

## Azure Pipelines Capabilities
- Cross-platform CI/CD automation
- Multi-provider Git integration (Azure DevOps, GitHub, Bitbucket)
- Extensive cloud platform compatibility (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- Unified deployment orchestration

## Learning Objectives
1. **Analyze** deployment pattern architectures and implementation strategies
2. **Evaluate** microservices architecture principles and distributed system design
3. **Compare** classical and modern deployment patterns for optimal release strategies
4. **Design** scalable deployment architectures aligned with organizational requirements

## Prerequisites
- Foundational understanding of DevOps principles and continuous delivery concepts
- Familiarity with version control systems and collaborative development workflows
- Experience in software delivery organizations (beneficial context)

## Critical Notes
- ⚠️ **Deployment ≠ CD**: Deployment is one component of comprehensive CD workflows
- 💡 **High-frequency deployment requires prerequisites**: Testing, quality, architecture
- 🎯 **Microservices optional**: Not prerequisite, but simplifies CD implementation
- 📊 **Azure Pipelines**: Unified platform for diverse tech stacks and cloud providers
- 🔄 **Production automation**: Quality gates + automated verification = immediate customer deployment
- ✨ **On-demand delivery**: Predictable reliability with minimal operational overhead
